Miscellaneous code
==================

- [life/](./life/) is the Game of Life. Implemented following a Global day 
  of Coderetreat. Done to only handle correct input to see what it would 
  look like if I followed my usual rules. The main thing missing is some 
  robustness around error handling that I'm not feeling like dealing with 
  since this isn't work :p
